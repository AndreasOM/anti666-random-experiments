# About

Simple command line tool to create textures from palettes.
(Because I was too lazy to open gimp and do a few clicks.)

# TODO
- [ ] Allow scaling of texture (aka more than one pixel per color)
- [ ] Allow setting of texture size (to allow room for extra things in texture)


# Notes
## Palette sources
